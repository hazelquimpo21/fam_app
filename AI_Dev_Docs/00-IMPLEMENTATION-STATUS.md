## Architecture Decisions

### Why These Choices?

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Next.js App Router | Server components, great DX |
| Supabase | All-in-one (DB, Auth, Realtime) |
| Magic Link Auth | Passwordless = better UX, more secure |
| TanStack Query | Best-in-class caching |
| Custom components vs shadcn | Full control, learning opportunity |
| Inline components in pages | MVP speed, extract later |

### Patterns Established

1. **Query Key Factory** - Consistent cache keys in `lib/query-keys.ts`
2. **Optimistic Updates** - Instant UI feedback for mutations
3. **Emoji Logging** - Friendly dev experience with debugging info
4. **RLS-First** - Security at database level
5. **Modular Hooks** - One hook file per entity
6. **Magic Link Auth** - Passwordless authentication
7. **Navigation Handlers** - Consistent logging + routing pattern
8. **JSDoc Comments** - Clear documentation for all hooks and components
9. **Loading Skeletons** - Per-page loading states
10. **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling with retry options

## Contributing

When adding new features:

1. **Database Changes** -> Add to migrations folder
2. **New Hook** -> Create in `lib/hooks/use-{entity}.ts`
3. **New Component** -> Add to appropriate folder in `components/`
4. **Query Keys** -> Add to `lib/query-keys.ts`
5. **Types** -> Add to `types/database.ts`

Keep files under 400 lines. Extract components when they grow.
